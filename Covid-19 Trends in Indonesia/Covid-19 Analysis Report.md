## Introduction
This is my personal project about Covid-19 trends in Indonesia in the years 2020 to 2022. The data were obtanied from Kaggle. The analysis aims to highlight Covid-19 cases and deaths across 34 regions in Indonesia.

The following points outline the insights I aimed to gain:
*    Which day had the maximum number of Covid-19 new cases in Indonesia?
*    Which day had the maximum number of Covid-19 new death cases in Indonesia?
*    What is the maximum number of confirmed cases and death cases in the years 2020 to 2022?
*    What region had the highest total confirmed cases in the years 2020 to 2022?

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
The data was sourced from Kaggle and was already well-structured and clean, formatted as a csv file.

## Data Processing
The tool I used to process the data is Looker Studio.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
In Looker Studio, I used 3 types kind of visualization as shown in Figure 1.

The dashboard shown below was created based on the data analysis.
