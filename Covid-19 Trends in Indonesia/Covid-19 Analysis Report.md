## Introduction
This is my personal project about Covid-19 trends in Indonesia in the years 2020 to 2022. The data were obtanied from Kaggle. The analysis aims to highlight Covid-19 cases and deaths across 34 regions in Indonesia.

The following points outline the insights I aimed to gain:
*    Which day had the maximum number of Covid-19 daily new cases in Indonesia?
*    Which day had the maximum number of Covid-19 new death cases in Indonesia?
*    What is the maximum number of confirmed cases and death cases in the years 2020 to 2022?
*    What region had the highest total confirmed cases in the years 2020 to 2022?

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
The data was sourced from Kaggle and was already well-structured and clean, formatted as a csv file.

## Data Processing
The tool I used to process the data is Looker Studio.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
In Looker Studio, I used 3 types kind of visualization as shown in Figure 1.

The dashboard shown below was created based on the data analysis.

## Data Interpretation
*    Based on data, we can see that there are 2 peak points for daily new cases in Indonesia, namely July 16, 2021 with a total of 53,992 new cases and Feb 16, 2022 with a total of 64,718 new cases.
*    On July 27, 2021, Indonesia recorded the highest number of daily new deaths, totaling 2,071 cases.
*    From 2020 to 2022, Indonesia recorded a total of 6,397,309 cases and 30,893 deaths.
*    The top 10 regions with the highest recorded cases in Indonesia are Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, East Java, Banten, Yogyakarta, East Kalimantan, Bali, North Sumatra, and Riau.

## Recommendations
*    Expand hospital and ICU capacity in high-risk regions like Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java.
*    Ensure adequate medical supplies, considering the peak of 2,071 daily deaths on July 27, 2021.
*    Strengthen testing and contact tracing to prevent surges like those on July 16, 2021 (53,992 cases) and February 16, 2022 (64,718 cases).
*    Prioritize booster shots in high-transmission areas such as Jakarta and East Java.
*    Apply flexible restrictions based on case trends to balance public health and the economy.
*    Government should provide financial aid for affected businesses and workers, considering 6.39 million total cases from 2020â€“2022.
